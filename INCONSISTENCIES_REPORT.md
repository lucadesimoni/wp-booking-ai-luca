# Inconsistencies and Missing Tests Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Naming Inconsistencies**
   - ✅ Updated plugin header in `wp-booking-system.php` to "WP booking Luca"
   - ✅ Updated admin menu title to "WP booking Luca"
   - ✅ Updated `readme.txt` to "WP booking Luca"
   - ✅ Updated `TESTING_GUIDE.md` references
   - ✅ Updated `QUICK_START.md` references
   - ⚠️ **Remaining**: Comments in CSS/JS files still reference "WP Booking System" (low priority)

2. **Missing Capacity Validation**
   - ✅ Added capacity validation to `submit_booking()` method
   - ✅ Added capacity validation to `calculate_price()` method
   - ✅ Added error handling in frontend JavaScript for capacity errors

3. **Missing Features in Documentation**
   - ✅ Added admin notification email setting to TESTING_GUIDE.md
   - ✅ Added chalet capacity setting to TESTING_GUIDE.md
   - ✅ Added Gutenberg block testing section
   - ✅ Added capacity validation testing

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues

1. **No Automated Tests**
   - ❌ No PHPUnit test files
   - ❌ No JavaScript unit tests
   - ❌ No integration tests
   - **Recommendation**: Create test structure with PHPUnit and Jest

2. **Missing Block Files in Build**
   - ❌ `assets/js/block.js` not included in build process
   - ❌ `includes/class-wp-booking-system-block.php` not included in build
   - **Recommendation**: Update build scripts to include new files

3. **Frontend Capacity Validation**
   - ⚠️ Capacity validation happens on backend but not proactively on frontend
   - **Recommendation**: Add real-time capacity validation in frontend JS

4. **Missing Test Coverage**
   - Database operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - AJAX handlers validation
   - Email sending functionality
   - Price calculations
   - Date availability checks
   - Capacity validation

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Create PHPUnit Test Structure**
   ```bash
   tests/

     │   ├── DatabaseTest.php
     │   ├── AjaxTest.php
     │   └── EmailTest.php
     └── integration/
         └── BookingFlowTest.php
   ```

2. **Update Build Scripts**
   - Include `block.js` in build
   - Include block class in build
   - Verify all new files are copied

3. **Add Frontend Capacity Validation**
   - Show capacity limit in form
   - Prevent submission if capacity exceeded
   - Real-time validation on guest count change
